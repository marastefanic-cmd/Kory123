# PHASE 12 — the next phase's raw material

**This is not a summary.** It is (a) the working memory for whoever picks the project up next, and
(b) the crash-recovery record for this session if its context clears. Everything here is either a
**debt**, a **user call with the evidence already gathered**, an **instrument that proved too
coarse**, or **something gear B revealed that gear A hid**.

Status when this file was opened: **round 1 gathering at 30/36**, `index.html` frozen until 36/36
(the plan cache keys on its bytes). Written against `docs/PHASE10.md` §8 and `docs/PHASE11.md` §1/§8.

## 1. USER CALLS — each with the evidence to answer it in one minute

> Rule for this section: state the question, the measurement that bears on it, and the cost of each
> answer. **Do not answer them here.** (`docs/PHASE11.md` §8 is the other list; these are additive.)

### 1.1 ★★★ Should the cross-val corpus move to the GEAR-AGNOSTIC character? (raised by the user, 07-26)

**The question.** The user's stated intent is a gear-agnostic benchmark "so we never have to deal
with this problem again" — *this problem* being the gear A → gear B re-export, which cost the project
its entire acceptance baseline (BENCH §1) and moved B2's target ~0.39 pp *and changed its sign*.

**The finding: the corpus is NOT gear-agnostic, and nothing says so out loud.** There are two
characters, and the split is not where a reader would guess:

| consumer | character | request template | gear-agnostic? |
|---|---|---|---|
| the **website button** | `sim/model-ref.json` | `sim/model-ref-request.json` | **yes** — synthetic, stats injected |
| `tools/bench.mjs --char bench` (default) | `tools/bench/export.json` | `tools/bench/export-request.json` | no |
| **the 36-table round** (`tools/xval-bench.mjs`) | `tools/bench/export.json` | `tools/bench/export-request.json` — **hardcoded at `:251`** | **no** |

`tools/xval-bench.mjs:251` reads the geared template with **no flag to switch it**. So the round in
flight is denominated in a character that can be re-exported — which is the precise mechanism that
voided the gear-A corpus. `sim/README.md` does state that the character is "deliberately *not*
shared", but it frames that as the page-vs-harness split; it does not warn that it is also what makes
the corpus re-baseline-able.

**What each answer costs.**
- **Switch to `model-ref`** ⇒ the 30/36 tables in flight are on the wrong character and the round
  restarts (~50 CPU-hours). Buys: the corpus never needs re-baselining again, and a corpus cell
  becomes reproducible by a *user* pressing the button — which has never been true.
- **Keep `bench/export.json`** ⇒ round 1 completes as gathered. Costs: the next gear change repeats
  07-26. Mitigation short of a switch: the `char=` stamp already on every `XVAL-DONE` line, plus
  freezing the export (already done — BENCH §1.1 reversed the never-commit-an-export policy).

**⚠ The honest counter-argument, which the user should hear before deciding.** `model-ref` does not
escape having an operating point — it injects SP/crit/haste, so it *has* one; what changes is that
the operating point is **declared in code** rather than exported from a gear file, so it cannot drift
silently. What is genuinely given up is what BENCH §1 argues the geared export is *for*: realistic
passives, set bonuses and hit — i.e. the stat distribution at which a layout is actually optimal.
**Whether scheduling conclusions transfer across stat distributions is an open empirical question
this project has never tested.** It is also cheaply testable, and that test should probably precede
the decision: solve one fight family on both characters and compare the argmax plan at each haste. If
the plans agree, the switch is nearly free; if they diverge, the geared export is load-bearing and
the answer is "keep it, and stamp harder".

### 1.2 Inherited from PHASE11 §8 — not restated here

`docs/PHASE11.md` §8 lists the platform-phase user calls (module split boundaries, product routes).
They are unchanged by tonight's work; **do not decide them here**. §1.1 above is additive to them.

## 2. WHAT GEAR B (and the 07-26 instrument) REVEALED THAT GEAR A HID

### 2.1 ★ The website's benchmark sim was scoring most of a plan as ZERO — and the tiles hid it

**How it surfaced.** The user screenshotted the live page: the *tile* read **`vs mashing +1.6%`**
while the *sim panel* under it read **`Model plan wins by +0.43%`** — the model and its own verifier
disagreeing by 3.8× on the same pair.

**Diagnosed by bisecting the character, not the model** (`--var 0.5`, 10k iters, seed 11, the
1:40 / Lust 0:07 / 1387 SP / 38% crit / isc+scb setup the user quoted):

```
screenshot                         model 1760.3  mash 1752.7  delta +0.43%

HEAD (trinkets on, lust on)        model 2099.4  mash 2062.4  delta 1.79%
trinkets STRIPPED, lust on         model 1970.8  mash 1948.9  delta 1.13%
trinkets on, lust OFF              model 1867.7  mash 1855.0  delta 0.69%
trinkets STRIPPED, lust OFF        model 1760.3  mash 1752.7  delta 0.43%   ← exact on all three
```

The screenshot is the **pre-PHASE10-§8.7 benchmark mage**, where the Icon press, the Gem press *and*
the Bloodlust press were each bit-identical no-ops. The sim could not see most of what the plan was
doing, so it scored the plan against mash as very nearly a tie. **PHASE10 §8.7 already fixed this on
this branch** — at HEAD the same setup reads model **+1.63%** vs sim **+1.79%**, which agree.

**The lasting lesson, and it is not "we fixed a bug".** A silent no-op does not read as an error; it
reads as *a small honest number*. The 0.43% looked exactly like a modest model-over-confidence
finding — which is the shape of the entire B2 investigation. Two guards now exist against it
(`planspec.mjs`'s `REQUIRES_EQUIPPED` refusing an unworn press, and `UNTRANSCRIBABLE` reporting
drops), and both postdate the gear-A corpus.

⚠ **Open question this raises about the archived corpus, worth one hour before trusting any gear-A
figure again:** the gear-A rounds ran before `REQUIRES_EQUIPPED` existed. Kits naming `skull` or
`mqg` against a two-slot character are exactly the configuration where a press silently does nothing.
Whether any gear-A table pressed an unworn trinket is *checkable* — the archived tables carry their
kits — and nobody has checked. If some did, the affected gear-A deficits were measured against a plan
the sim never actually executed.

### 2.2 The page and the terminal are the same mechanism — now MEASURED, not argued

Driving the page's own arm-A path in Chromium (over http; `file://` blocks both the module imports
and the Worker) against `tools/bench.mjs --char model-ref` on one setup:

```
page      spec {"_prestack":0,"Icon":[8],"BL":[7],"AP":[8],"Gem":[8],"Zerk":[28],"IV":[8,39],"CS":[39]}
          protocol {iterations:10000, seed:11, variation:0.5}     arm-A DPS 2099.381726802044
terminal  same spec, same protocol                                arm-A DPS 2099.4
```

**Why this is worth keeping (see §4.1):** `tests/sim-request.mjs` §1+§2 — the page-vs-terminal
request comparison — **SKIPS without a native `RUNNER`**. So on a bare container (and in any CI that
does not build Go) the strongest standing claim in `sim/README.md` is *unexercised*. The probe above
closes that gap using only the committed wasm.

## 3. DEBTS CREATED OR LEFT OPEN TONIGHT

| # | debt | state |
|---|---|---|
| 3.1 | Corpus character is the geared export, not gear-agnostic | **user call — §1.1** |
| 3.2 | Did any gear-A table press an unworn trinket? | **unchecked** — §2.1 |
| 3.3 | `tests/sim-request.mjs` §1+§2 unexercised without a native runner | probe exists (§2.2); promote per §4.1 |
| 3.4 | `RULES.md` figures are gear-A; banner added, **none re-measured** | banner landed 07-26 |
| 3.5 | §12 crossover thresholds (`~264`, `~139`, `~77`) are haste/SP functions | most likely to have moved; re-derive first |

---

## 4. INSTRUMENTS THAT PROVED TOO COARSE (or absent)

### 4.1 `tests/sim-request.mjs` skips its two most important checks on a bare container
See §2.2. The page-vs-terminal equivalence is the claim `sim/README.md` rests on, and it is the one
a fresh container cannot check. **A wasm-only equivalence test belongs in `tests/`** and is the
natural first CI gate (goal step 7): it needs no Go toolchain, runs in ~10 s, and it is the only
gate that covers the page's *own* `opts` assembly at `index.html:4666`, which is not shared code.

### 4.2 `exact-match` is blind to the TRINKETS reorder by construction
Already recorded in PHASE10-RESUME §3b and **not re-derived here** — but it belongs on this list
because it is the cleanest example of a green gate that is *not evidence*: `tests/exact-match.mjs:47`
declares its own `ALL_BUFFS` and never calls `applyState`, so the reorder's real blast radius
(`applyState`'s two-slot clamp at `index.html:5114`) is invisible to it. 25/25 is expected and proves
nothing about ordering.

## 5. CORRECTIONS TO BELIEFS HELD AT THE START OF THIS SESSION

- **"`/tmp/run-round.sh` and `/tmp/chain-bossshards.sh` drove a 50-CPU-hour round and exist in no
  repo."** — **False as of this session.** All three drivers are tracked and **byte-identical** to
  their `/tmp` copies: `tools/xval-round-pipeline.sh`, `tools/xval-boss-warm.sh`,
  `tools/xval-boss-presolve.sh`. The container-reclaim risk they represented is closed.
  ⚠ Residual: they carry a **hardcoded session-scratchpad `SP=` path**, so `xval-boss-warm.sh`'s
  wait-loop polls a log that a *future* session will never create and would hang forever. Fixed
  separately; noted here because "promoted" and "reproducible" are not the same property.
