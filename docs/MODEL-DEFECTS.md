# MODEL DEFECTS — where the planner disagrees with an established fact

`docs/ESTABLISHED-FACTS.md` records **facts**: measured, reproducible cooldown behaviour, with no
commentary about the planner. This file is the other half — every place the model fails to reproduce
one of those facts, with its size, its reproduction, and whether the mechanism is known.

Keeping them apart is deliberate. A fact stays true when the model is fixed; a defect does not. Mixed
into one document, neither reads cleanly, and the facts file becomes hard to trust as a reference.

## How to use this file

1. A defect here means: **the sim satisfies an established fact and the model does not.** That is the
   only thing that qualifies. A model/sim gap where the SIM is the odd one out is a harness problem,
   not a model defect, and belongs in `docs/TOOLING.md`.
2. Sizes are quoted in **casts**, not percentages — a percentage of a single cooldown's value sounds
   enormous when the cooldown is small. One cast at Baseline A is 2242.1 damage.
3. Before fixing, reproduce. Every entry carries the exact command.

## D1 — the model resolves sub-cast lattice phase as though it were damage

**Status: OPEN. Mechanism not established. Three witnesses, one bug.**

The model books *where the cast lattice happens to land* as real expected damage. Because a cooldown's
placement shifts every cast after it, a placement that is genuinely worth the same can come out ahead
by a fraction of a cast — and the model spends real layout quality chasing it.

| witness | size | the fact it violates |
|---|---|---|
| Berserking "prefers" partial Bloodlust overlap over sitting fully inside it | **0.185 casts** | RULES §5b |
| Icy Veins before Bloodlust valued above Icy Veins inside it | **0.287 casts** | ESTABLISHED-FACTS §1 rule 1 |
| Bloodlust at t=15 s valued above Bloodlust at t=5 s or t=10 s | **0.178 casts** | ESTABLISHED-FACTS §3 rule 1 |

All three are **sub-cast**, all three are on placements that shift the downstream lattice, and all
three are **deterministic** — the Bloodlust figure is identical at 10 000 and 60 000 iterations, so it
is not Monte-Carlo noise.

### Reproduction

    node tools/buff-atlas.mjs --T 60 --sp 1000 --crit 25 --haste 0 --step 5 --iter 60000 --md

Bloodlust's sim column is flat to **0.00 %** across every interior placement. The model's is not: it
pays 13547.2 at 5 s and 10 s and **13946.2** at 15 s.

### The direction to look, from the user (07-28)

> *"The only difference can possibly be the clipping of haste buffs that miraculously align in a way
> that if you pop IV a little earlier it can clip an extra cast, but that is not executable in the
> fight, and I think that's why we previously went with the integral equation."*

The retired rate integral was the **phase average**; the discrete per-cast sum realizes **one** phase.
That is the trade to re-examine.

⚠ **Not** by restoring the integral as the arbiter — it disagreed with the per-cast sum by a median
0.2114 % of score against ranking margins of ~0.005–0.07 %, which is why it was retired
(archived PHASE12 §6.10). And **not** by giving up the boundary credit, which is a separate and
correct thing (a cast that does not fit earns the fraction that does). The question is narrower: should
the *terminal* phase of a plan be realized or averaged?

### What has already been ruled out

Two mechanisms were proposed, measured, and **falsified** — recorded so nobody spends the afternoon
again:

* **Ramp compression.** "Icy Veins on the opening ramp buys a whole cast." It buys **0.068 %**
  (sim, `IV@0` vs `IV@20` bare, +1.1 DPS ± 0.07 over 5 seeds), not a cast.
* **Snapshot spill.** "A cast begun under the buff finishes hasted, so a placement that spills more
  past the window edge is worth more." Spill varies 4× (0.246 s → 0.996 s) across placements and the
  value is **identical** in every one. The model already handles the snapshot rule correctly.

### Partial mitigation already shipped

`structuralSnap` (RULES §5b) breaks ties toward the structurally sensible layout when the difference is
inside the 0.05 % band. It bounds the *symptom* — it does not fix the cause, and the Bloodlust witness
(2.92 % of that cooldown's value) is well outside the band it can reach.

## ⚠ Unresolved — a pull advantage at h=0 that should not exist

**Status: OPEN QUESTION, not yet classified.** At h=0, pressing a haste cooldown at the pull is worth
**+2.8 % (model) / +2.1 % (sim)** over any interior placement — about **0.05 of a cast**.

It is in **both** columns, so it is not D1 (which is model-only by definition). But by the arithmetic it
should not exist: at h=0 nothing is floored, the ramp casts are cast-bound and the steady casts are
GCD-bound, and a haste multiplier divides both by the same factor. ESTABLISHED-FACTS rule 3 explains a
pull advantage **at and above a buff's cap threshold** — h=0 is far below every threshold (the lowest,
Bloodlust, is 243).

It is also **perfectly stable**: 2.812 % at all 12 spell-power × crit combinations, to three decimals.
A quantity that constant is a mechanism, not noise.

⇒ Two possibilities, and picking between them matters: either it is a real effect neither the arithmetic
nor rule 3 captures, **or** part of what is filed above as D1 is real and the model is not wrong about
it. Do not fix D1 without settling this first.

## Not defects — recorded so they are not re-filed

* **Serpent-Coil's steady-state column is not flat in the SIM** (1.85 % at 60 k iterations). The model
  is exactly flat. The spread **shrinks with iterations** (2.98 % → 1.85 %) and wanders
  non-monotonically on the smallest value in the table (≈33 DPS against ~1700 total). That is
  Monte-Carlo noise, not a mechanism, and not a fact — see ESTABLISHED-FACTS §8.
* **A haste cooldown is worth more pressed at the pull.** Real, and in both columns: the ramp casts are
  longer than the GCD floor, so haste still converts there. It grows with passive haste and becomes the
  *entire* value of the cooldown above the cap. ESTABLISHED-FACTS rule 3.
